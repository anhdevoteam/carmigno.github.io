This is the repository for my website/blog. It's still a work in progress, but I like to keep it already online. Hopefully useful posts will pop up soon. 

## TODO list

- [ ] add links to personal social profiles
- [ ] Think of more pages to add to the navigation bar
- [x] Check comments (not adding them)
