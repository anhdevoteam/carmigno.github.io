Hello dear visitor,

I am Carmine, the guy in the picture. I currently work as a Data Engineering Consultant for Devoteam, in Amsterdam.

    My nose got burnt while I was enjoying a beautiful <br />afternoon of sun at the Vondelpark. I regret nothing.

I landed on the cloud after exploring a bunch of different things: I studied Biomedical Engineering, I did some research in the electromagnetics field, then I played around with Cognitive Neuroscience, then I was for a few years a Data Scientist in the Healthcare field. Ultimately, I realized I really like to build nice things, so I moved to Data Engineering. I also care a lot about my teammates and I love to think about ways to leverage technology to solve strategic issues, therefore it is my goal to become a Lead once I have enough experience. 

I like writing, so in my jobs I often end up being the guy who writes documentation for everything. I thought it was a shame to not share the results of this passion with more people, so here we are: I built this blog to address this need.

If you feel like reaching out to me for remarks, suggestions, or to ask what hair products I use, [you can do it on linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnolo/). If the grammar in the name of the blog sounds weird to you, you may be right. I picked it as a reference to [one of my favorite movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Mood_for_Love). Here is a small 2 minutes preview from the Criterion Collection channel on YouTube
