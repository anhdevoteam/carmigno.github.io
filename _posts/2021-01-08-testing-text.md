I want to see how it looks like online. I have noticed that the theme is built around the concept of centered titles, and here it comes from the head settings. Therefore, I should not use the # level title, but only the further ones. 
## Look at this second level title
### Third level

Here is some code to see how it goes

```python
import pandas as pd
a = 1
b = 1+1
```

Also some sql because why not

```sql
SELECT * FROM db.schema.table
WHERE 1=1
AND test = 'yes'
```

Maybe some LaTeX, because why not, right?
