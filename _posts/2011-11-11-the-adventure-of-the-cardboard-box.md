# This is a test post

I want to see how it looks like online. 

## Look at this second level title

Here is some code to see how it goes

```python
import pandas as pd
a = 1
b = 1+1
```



Also some sql because why not

```sql
SELECT * FROM db.schema.table
WHERE 1=1
AND test = 'yes'
```



Maybe some LaTeX, because why not $\cfrac{x}{y}$



And of course some mermaid

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
